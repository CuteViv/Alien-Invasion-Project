# Alien-Invasion-Project

Summary: we'll make a ship that can move right and left and fires bullets when the player presses the spacebar. After setting up this behaviour, we can create the
aliens and refine the gameplay.

## Create a ship that fires bullets:  
1. Create a pygame window and respond to user input  
2. Set a background colour    
3. Create a settings class  
4. Add the ship image  
5. Create the ship class 
6. Draw the ship to the screen 
7. refactoring: add the _check_events() and _update_screen() methods 
8. Respond to a keypress  
9. Allow continuous movement  
10. Move both left and right     
11. Adjust the ship's speed 
12. Limit the ship's range  
13. Refactoring _check_events() 
14. Press Q to quit 
15. Run the game in fullscreen mode 
16. Add the bullet settings 
17. Create the bullet class 
18. Store bullets in a group  
19. Fire bullets  
20. Delete old bullets  
21. Limit the number of bullets 
22. Create the _update_bullets() method
